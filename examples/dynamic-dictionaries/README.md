# Dynamic Dictionaries

Getting a list of dictionaries based upon a file scan.

Sample words in the dictionaries:

- applemoose
- bananasplitter
- carrottop

This example contains two example configuration files: `codetypo.config.mjs` and `codetypo.config.cjs`. CodeTypo v8 and above will by default load the `.mjs` file while v7 needs the `.cjs` file.
